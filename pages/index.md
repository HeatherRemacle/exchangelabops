## Definition of a Modern Application
A modern application is one that exhibits five important characteristics:
1. It supports multiple users through the interface of their choice
  - Web, Mobile, API (application programming interface)
2. It provides an API for accessing data over [HTTP(S)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS){:target="_blank"} for all features that would normally be available over a graphical user interface (GUI) or the command line interface (CLI)
3. Its data is available via generic formats (such as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON){:target="_blank"} or XML)
4. It is built on a modern stack that supports the creation of an application with an HTTP interface and an API which can consume and emit JSON data
5. It conforms to the relevant elements of a [12-factor](https://12factor.net/){:target="_blank"} application
